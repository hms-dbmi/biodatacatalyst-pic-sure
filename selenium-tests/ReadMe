To Run the regression of Quickstart , we should have some prerequisites. Please check the below steps.


1.Create Config.properties file, it has mapping of property value with  test data files path 
which is going to run against  test methods.


2.All the test data files have input and expected parameters - name, url,authmethod etc.

3.Path to Config.properties can be configurable; while running ./runchromeheadless.sh you can pass path to Config.properties
  from command prompt. 
  
  Chmod 777 ./runchromeheadless.sh
  
  E.g.   ./runchromeheadless.sh -Dpathtoconfigtest="src/test/resources/"
 
 Also note that crontab is set to run the test on every Monday.
 
 Please export the cron to crontab
 
 crontab ~/automatepicsure/pic-sure-ui-selenium/Crontab
  

4.For each environment like Nhanes, grdr the values like url, username, password,patient count etc.
  differs, so before we run the test automation code please make sure these value should get updated correctly, 
  else the test result will be "failed".

5.You can check the result and test run logs under root/pic-sure-ui-selenium/QuickstartLog.log. 
  You can change the logfile name and logging level (e.g. INFO,DEBUG,ALL etc) as you wish by updating
  log4j.properties file.
